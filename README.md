EU_Sperstore Data
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a store. The data includes customer IDs, invoice IDs, order IDs, order dates, shipping dates, country regions, customer states, categories of products purchased, total sales, profit, and discounts. The analysis is performed using R code in an Rmd file, specifically using the Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) analysis technique and other customer-related metrics. The results of the analysis are visualized in a dashboard.
